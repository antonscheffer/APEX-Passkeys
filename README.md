# APEX-Passkeys
A small Oracle APEX 22.2 app showing how you can use a DA plugin to Sign In using Passkeys, aka WebAuthn.
I developed this using the Windows Hello passkeys. So I'm sure that it works with that type of Passkeys, but I confirmed that it also worked on a Sammsung and an Apple phone. No guarantee for a Macintosh or a (removable) FIDO device.
