# APEX-Passkeys
A small Oracle APEX 22.2 app showing how you can use a DA plugin to Sign In using Passkeys, aka WebAuthn.
I developed this using the Windows Hello passkeys. So I'm sure that it works with that type of Passkeys, but I confirmed that it also worked on a Samsung and an Apple phone. I've heard that it also working on MacOS.

A (removable) FIDO device is currently not working.
( anyone interested in sponsoring me a device? @Yubico @token2 )

I just received a YubiKey 5C NFC, thanks [Infinigate](https://www.infinigate.com/nl/), so expect an update to this app soon.
